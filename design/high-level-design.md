# High-Level Design

## System Overview
The Perplexity Server provides a bridge between Claude and Perplexity's AI-powered internet search API. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using the @anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk package.

## Core Components

1. MCP Server Integration
   - Uses @anthropic-ai/mcp-sdk for MCP implementation
   - StdioServerTransport for communication with Claude
   - Full MCP protocol support

2. API Integration
   - Direct integration with Perplexity API using Axios
   - Handles authentication and request configuration
   - Manages retries and error handling

3. Validation & Type Safety
   - Uses Zod for runtime validation
   - TypeScript types for compile-time safety
   - Validates both incoming requests and API responses

4. Logging System
   - File and console logging
   - Timestamps on all entries
   - Supports log retrieval via MCP resources

## Protocol Implementation

1. MCP Tools
   - perplexity_search: Main search tool
   - Proper schema definitions
   - Error handling per MCP spec

2. MCP Resources
   - Logs access
   - Resource listing
   - Content retrieval

3. Tool Interface
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "perplexity_search";
     description: string;
     parameters: {
       messages: Message[];
       searchDomainFilter?: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. API Key Management
   - Environment variables
   - Command line arguments
   - Never logged or exposed

2. Error Handling
   - Safe error messages
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Proper cleanup on exit

3. Input Validation
   - All inputs validated
   - Size limits enforced
   - Type checking

## Performance Considerations

1. Response Time
   - Efficient message processing
   - Proper timeout handling
   - Async operations

2. Resource Usage
   - Memory efficient logging
   - Stream processing where possible
   - Proper cleanup

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Component isolation
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests
   - End-to-end flows
   - API interaction
   - Protocol compliance

3. Performance Tests
   - Response times
   - Memory usage
   - Load handling

## Development Guidelines

1. Code Organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular design
   - Type-first approach

2. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error types
   - Proper error propagation
   - Informative messages

3. Logging
   - Consistent format
   - Appropriate detail level
   - Performance impact considered
