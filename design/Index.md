Design document for the Perplexity MCP Server exports
Exports: Making our code available to the world!

# Design Context and Background

## Purpose
The index.ts file serves as the main entry point for importing the Perplexity MCP server components. It exports only the necessary public interfaces while keeping implementation details private.

## Key Design Decisions
1. Public Interface
   - Export only the main server class
   - Export necessary types for configuration
   - Keep implementation details private

2. Organization
   - Clear separation between types and implementation
   - Export everything from a single point

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep exports minimal and focused
- Document any breaking changes to public interfaces

# Table of Contents
- Module: index.ts

## Overview
Main export module for the Perplexity MCP server package

## Design Requirements
1. MUST export PerplexityServer class
   Source: High-level design document
2. MUST export necessary configuration types
   Source: TypeScript best practices

## Design Considerations
1. Export Organization
   - WHY: Provide clear public interface
   - HOW: Group related exports together
   - EXAMPLE:
     ```typescript
     export { PerplexityServer } from './server/PerplexityServer';
     export type { PerplexityConfig } from './types/PerplexityConfig';
     ```

## Module Content
```typescript
// Server exports
export { PerplexityServer } from './server/PerplexityServer';

// Type exports
export type { 
    PerplexityConfig,
} from './types/PerplexityConfig';

export type {
    Message,
    ChatCompletionResponse,
    Choice,
    Usage
} from './types/PerplexityTypes';
```
