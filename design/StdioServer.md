# StdioServer Design

## Overview
The StdioServer implements the MCP protocol over standard input/output. Due to protocol requirements, stdout is reserved for protocol responses, requiring careful handling of logging and debug output.

## Design Requirements

1. Debug Tracing
   - MUST accept --debug flag to enable tracing
   - MUST trace both incoming commands and outgoing responses when debug enabled
   - MUST trace both API requests and responses when debug enabled
   - MUST NOT interfere with protocol message flow
   - MUST distinguish between protocol events and API interactions

2. Protocol Message Handling
   - MUST use StdioServerTransport from MCP SDK for protocol I/O
   - MUST maintain protocol message integrity on stdout
   - MUST handle protocol errors without breaking message flow
   - MUST trace the full content of MCP protocol messages in debug mode

3. Error Handling
   - MUST log all errors regardless of debug mode
   - MUST include error details sufficient for diagnosis
   - MUST report errors to stderr for operator visibility
   - MUST maintain protocol message integrity even during errors
   - MUST log stack traces when available

4. Server Lifecycle
   - MUST validate command line arguments before starting
   - MUST check API key presence and source
   - MUST log startup configuration in debug mode
   - MUST cleanly shut down on fatal errors

## Message Flow

1. Normal Mode (--debug not set)
   - Transport handles all stdin/stdout
   - Errors reported to stderr
   - No debug tracing

2. Debug Mode (--debug set)
   - Transport handles all stdin/stdout
   - Full protocol message tracing to log
   - API interaction tracing to log
   - Server events to log
   - Errors to both log and stderr

## Event Categories
- Protocol commands and responses
- API requests and responses
- Error conditions (logged in all modes) 
- Server lifecycle events

## Implementation Notes

1. Command Line Processing
   - Parse arguments before initialization
   - Check API key sources in order
   - Set debug mode from flag
   - Show help and exit if requested

2. Debug Mode
   - Log after argument parsing
   - Log before server start
   - Log all protocol interactions
   - Log all API interactions

3. Error Handling
   - Log all errors regardless of mode
   - Include stack traces when possible
   - Report to stderr for visibility
   - Maintain protocol message integrity
